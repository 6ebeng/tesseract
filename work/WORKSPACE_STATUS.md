# Kurdish OCR Training Workspace - Clean Status

## 🎯 Workspace Summary

**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ CLEANED AND ORGANIZED

## 📊 Cleanup Results

### Before Cleanup:

- **Output files:** 68 files (33MB)
- **Scripts:** 32 scripts
- **Status:** Cluttered with test files and experiments

### After Cleanup:

- **Output files:** 26 files (30MB)
- **Scripts:** 15 essential scripts
- **Removed:** 42+ test files, 16+ redundant scripts
- **Space saved:** ~3MB + organization

## ✅ What Was Preserved

### Essential Files:

- ✅ Main Kurdish corpus (`ckb.training_text`)
- ✅ LSTM model components (`ckb_base.*`)
- ✅ Kurdish unicharset with UTF-8 support
- ✅ Working training scripts with UTF-8 encoding
- ✅ PowerShell training launcher
- ✅ CTC diagnostic tools

### Working Models (Untouched):

- ✅ `ckb.traineddata` (15MB) - Main Kurdish model
- ✅ `ckb_custom.traineddata` (15MB) - Custom model

## 🗑️ What Was Removed

### Test Files:

- ❌ All `*test*` files
- ❌ Experimental training files (`exp0-exp4`)
- ❌ Temporary UTF-8 test files
- ❌ Arabic base model attempts
- ❌ Failed training attempts

### Redundant Scripts:

- ❌ 16+ outdated training scripts
- ❌ Broken CTC training attempts
- ❌ Redundant pipeline scripts
- ❌ Old cleanup utilities

### Temporary Files:

- ❌ All `*tmp*` and `*temp*` files
- ❌ Test corpus variations
- ❌ Result files from experiments

## 🚀 Ready-to-Use Commands

### For Kurdish OCR (Recommended):

```powershell
# Use existing working models
wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -c "export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/mnt/c/tesseract/tessdata && tesseract image.png output -l ckb"
```

### For UTF-8 Training (If needed):

```powershell
cd c:\tesseract\work
.\run_training.ps1
# Select option 7: Simple UTF-8 LSTM Training
```

### For Workspace Management:

```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash /mnt/c/tesseract/work/scripts/cleanup_workspace.sh
```

## 📈 Benefits

- ✅ **Faster navigation** - 42+ fewer files to browse
- ✅ **Clear purpose** - Only essential and working files remain
- ✅ **UTF-8 ready** - All scripts configured for proper encoding
- ✅ **Space efficient** - 3MB+ space saved
- ✅ **Maintenance ready** - Easy to understand structure

## 🎉 Final Status

**Your Kurdish OCR workspace is now clean, organized, and ready for production use with full UTF-8 support!**
